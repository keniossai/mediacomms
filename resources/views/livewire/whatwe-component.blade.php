                        Over the decades, the gap in communities' capacity to express their experiences, and grievances
                        at the grassroots level has unfortunately expanded. The social disconnect is quite alarming,
                        considering these stakeholders form the bulk of modern society, especially within the Nigerian
                        polity. They form the living numbers on all election dates; Women, men and young people year in
                        year out having expectations in administrations and systems that fail them consistently because
                        for so long, these communities have been without a unified platform and voice to demand
                        accountability and quality governance from their political officeholders.

                        Communities have been kept in the dark and trapped by the weapons of illiteracy, poverty and
                        religious bias by ill-meaning leaders and stakeholders who seek only personal interests at the
                        expense of their immediate and larger constituents. These communities can help to build a more
                        inclusive society when they are empowered and equipped to use their voice creatively and
                        responsibly for democratic participation in governance and overall advancement of their
                        wellbeing.
